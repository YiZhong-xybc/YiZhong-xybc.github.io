I am currently a senior undergraduate student majoring in Electronic Information Engineering at China Agricultural University. I will begin pursuing my Ph.D. at Tongji University in fall 2026.

My research interests lie in **reinforcement learning** and **autonomous driving**. In particular, I am fascinated by the intersection of control, robotics, and artificial intelligence, and how these fields converge to enable intelligent autonomous systems.

I am eager to explore challenging problems in autonomous decision-making and contribute to advancing the state of the art in these areas.
