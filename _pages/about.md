I am currently a senior undergraduate student majoring in Electronic Information Engineering at China Agricultural University. Starting from 2025, I will pursue my Ph.D. at Tongji University.

My research interests lie in motion planning and reinforcement learning. I am particularly fascinated by the intersection of control, robotics, and artificial intelligence, and how these fields converge to enable intelligent autonomous systems.

I am eager to explore challenging problems in autonomous decision-making and contribute to advancing the state-of-the-art in these areas.
